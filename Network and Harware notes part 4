MODULE 4 - NETWORK BASICS
______________________________________
	-Sharing resources and transfering data in a network
	-Intro to TCP/IP
	-Networking devices
	-Media and topologies
	-IP addressing and ports
---------------------------------------
Lesson 1 - NETWORK MODELS
	-TCP/IP network model is the standard
	-TCP/IP was developed around 1972-1973
	
	-Message routing
		-enables communication between networks
		-Messages are divided into packets
		-Each packet has an IP address from the source and destination
		-TCP/IP determines travel path
		-Upon completion a confirmation is relayed back to source

	TCP/IP MODEL
		-Packets travel from Application, Transport, Internet, and Link.  And back up
		-Packets are encapusulated and decapsulated
		
			-Application layer: Email, web, DNS, common services(Gateways, Proxy, App firewalls, IDS)
				
			-Transport layer: TCP/UDP (Firewalls)
		
			-Internet layer: IP, ICMP, ARP (Routers, Switches)
		
			-Link layer: Ethernet, Serial, Frame relay, ATM (NIC)(Switches)

	TCP three way hand shake
		-SYN -> SYN+ACK -> ACK
	
	Routers
		-Link networks together
		-Fragment data packetst o fit different sizes
		-Each port on a router can have its own NIC and MAC address
		-Routers use convergence to share info to other routers
		-The info shared includes routing tables, hosts, ips

	MAC address
		-48-bit 12 digit number.
		-six group of two digit hex
		-First half is OUI, unique to manufacturer
		-Second half is unique to the specific card
		
	NICs
		-use MACs for addressing
	
	Switches
		-can reduce broadcast traffic and segment a network
		-Can direct data packets(Link Layer)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 2- Transmission Media
	-Cable communication
	-Wireless
------------------------------------------------------------------
	-Bandwith
		-How much data the channel can handle
	-Attenuation
		-Weakening of a signal
	-Twisted pair cabling
		-UTP- unshielded 
		-STP- shielded
	-Common types of cable
		-CAT 5, CAT 5e, CAT 6
	-Connectors
		-RJ-45, RJ-11 and RJ12 for phones
	-Fiber-optic
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 3 - NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
	-Physical
	-Star
	-Mesh

	CSMA/CD: Cabled
	CSMA/CA: Wireless

	Network Speeds
	-100BaseX: 100Mb/sec
	-1000BaseX: 1Gb/sec
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 5 - INTERNET LAYER PROTOCOLS
	
	-IPv4: 32bits 32 digits
		-Three classes A,B,C
		-subnets: are segments of the network that share a common IP
		-subnet mask: masks to outside ip, Three types A,B,C
	
	-IPV6: 
		-128 bits, 8 groups of 4 digit numbers
		-Loopback address for IPv6 is ::1/128 similar to 127.0.0.1
	
Commands
	-ping, ipconfig, net use, net view
	
TCP: connection oriented
UDP: conectionless
	-ex. NFS, NTP, DHCP, TFTP, DNS, NBNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 7 - APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOLS

	-Protocols in the application layer
		-SMTP, FTP, HTTPS, SNMP
	-DHCP
		-ipconfig /release
		-ipconfig /renew

	-Ports
		-1-1023 are the well-known ports
		
	-To list open ports
		-netstat -an
		-netstat by itself shows current connections
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 8 - NETWORK TYPES

		-ISDN is telecommunications
		-Data is sectioned in packets
	
	LANS and WANS
		-peer to peer and client-server
	Fiber optimic
		-fast ONT(optic Network Terminal) converts from fiber to ethernet
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 9 - Network Security
	Encryption
		-Symmetric: same key used to encrypt and decrypt
		-Public key asymmetric 
			-public and private keys used together for decryption
		-VLAN
			-segment and divide networks
		
		-Firewalls
			-Can block unauthorized access, ports, URLs, apps, servics

		-NAT
			-allows the use of internal nonroutable IPs connected with one public facing IP address
			-A device with NAT the internal ip before sending to the internet
		-Packet filtering firewall
			-Filters packet header(sorce and destination info)
		-Stateful Insection
			-Examines the packets and behavior beyond headers
		-Application-gateway firewalls
			-Checks connections between services run on internal to external 
			-Acts as a proxy
			-Can have NAT, URL filtering, audit logs
		-IDS
			-Monitors signs of intrusion
			-detects with alerts
			-Network and host based
