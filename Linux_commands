Logging:
The script surveyTranscript.txt command causes
the current window to record all the input and output that occurs
in the terminal, which is a convenient way to record the output of
all commands run in the survey. Typing exit ends the recording.
Remember to copy the transcript file off the target and delete it
before ending the session.

STANDARD DIRECTORIES:
• /etc—most configuration files
• /bin—system executables (called binaries) intended for users
• /sbin—system executables intended for administrators
• /var—dynamic (variable) information, log files, traditionally web files
• /usr—files not part of the OS
• /usr/bin—programs (not part of the OS) intended for users
• /usr/sbin—programs (not part of the OS) intended for admins
• /proc—virtual file system (not on disk) access to read kernel memory
• /boot—boot loader configuration and kernel images. Anything needed
before the kernel is running.
• /tmp—temporary file storage
• /media—mount point for removable media (like USB drives)


Basic Information commands:
date: command that outputs system date/time
uname -a: outputs kernel version
w: shows users currently logged on the system
last: outputs logon and logoff info
ps -efH: command prints the full process list
netstat –tunap: to gather data on network sockets
lsof: lists all open file descriptors and sockets


User Information: Examine the user and group permission files, e.g.,
 /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow and /etc/group
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/shadow
cat /etc/group

Startup Information:

Look at MAC times of all init scripts. May detect suspicious changes:
ls -Rlacrt /etc/init.d
ls -Rlaurt /etc/init.d
ls -Rlart /etc/init.d
Retrieve the inittab configuration file and the associated scripts:
cat /etc/inittab
cat /etc/rc.d/rc
cat /etc/rc.sysinit
cat /etc/rc.local
Retrieve the cron configuration, and any scheduled jobs:
cat /etc/crontab
ls /etc/cron.*
cat /etc/anacrontab
cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/*

Logging Information:
cat /var/log/messages
cat /etc/syslog.conf
cat /var/log/messages
cat /var/log/secure
cat /root/.bash_history
cat /home/*/.bash_history
________________________________________________________________

Some of the keys to look for include the following:
• Malicious or abnormal processes
• Personal security products (PSPs) such as antivirus, firewalls, etc.
• Logging (specifically what might catch or have caught activity of interest)
• Suspicious files or modified system configurations
________________________________________________________________

Shows the system’s network interface configuration
ifconfig –a
ip addr show



arp -v: Displays the ARP cache, which may reveal LAN peers
________________________________________________________________
Displays the routing table
netstat –rn
route –n
ip route list
________________________________________________________________
iptables –L –n: Lists firewall rules
lsof –i -nP: Shows sockets by looking at open files versus networking services. Comparing this output
to the netstat can reveal hidden processes or communications
________________________________________________________________
lsmmod: outputs kernel modules

mount: shows mounted file systems
df -h: shows drive spaced percentage used

cat /etc/mtab: show current mounted file systems
cat /etc/fstab: shows table of file systems available to be mounted

COMMANDS

cat [FILE] concatenate file to screen
cd change directory
cp [SOURCE] [TARGET] copy SOURCE to TARGET
file determine file type
find search for files in directory hierarchy
grep PATTERN [FILE] print lines matching PATTERN from FILE
groupadd create a new group
groups print the groups a user belongs to
head [FILE] output first 10 lines of a file
less [FILE]similar to more but handles larger files muchfaster
locate find files by name (Linux)
ln –s [TARGET] [LINK_NAME] create symbolic link from SOURCE to LINK_NAME
ls directory listing
man display online help
man –k SEARCH_STRING search for specified SEARCH_STRING in man pages
more [FILE] output the contents
mv [SOURCE] [TARGET] rename/move SOURCE to TARGET
pwd show current directory
ps report a snapshot of current processes
scp secure copy – remote file copy utility
script make a transcript of a terminal session
stat display file or file system status
strace trace system calls and signals 
tail [FILE] output last 10 lines of a file
tail –f [FILE] continuously output the contents of FILE as it is written to, starting with the last 10 lines
tar tape archiving (similar to WinZip/PKZIP)
truss trace system calls and signals (Solaris)
useradd create a user account
usermod modify a user account
wc print number of bytes, words, lines in files
which show full path of shell commands

bg lists any stopped or background jobs
fg brings the most recent job to foreground
fg n brings job n to the foreground
kill -l list all available signal names
kill PID kill process with an ID of PID
killall PROCESS
pkill PROCESS kill all processes named PROCESS
ps display active processes

date show the current system date and time
df show current disk usage
du show directory space usage
id show your current User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID)
last show listing of last logged in users
lastb show listing of bad login attempts
w display who is currently online
w -r displays the current runlevel
whoami shows who you are logged in as
uname –a show kernel information

(dot files are hidden) e.g. /root/.ssh
ls -a: to show all files

To find hidden directories, type:
find / -name ‘...’ –print
find / -name ‘.* *’ –print

mount: shows current security settings
 
To limit user processes, add a user name or group name, or add all users to the
/etc/security/limits.conf file and impose process limitations.

Search SUID root executables:
find / -user root –perm -4000 | xargs -0 ls -l

Look for extra SUID 0 Accounts (root level user) by typing:
awk -F: ‘($3 = = 0) { print $1 }’ /etc/passwd

Display etc/shadow from user:
passwd -S <username>

Display what is loaded in the kernel:
lsmod

Output the info on a module:
modinfo <mod name>

To remove modules:
rmmod -f

Blacklist a module:
blacklist <modulename >
