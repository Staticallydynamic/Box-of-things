Logging:
The script surveyTranscript.txt command causes
the current window to record all the input and output that occurs
in the terminal, which is a convenient way to record the output of
all commands run in the survey. Typing exit ends the recording.
Remember to copy the transcript file off the target and delete it
before ending the session.


Basic Information commands:
date: command that outputs system date/time
uname -a: outputs kernel version
w: shows users currently logged on the system
last: outputs logon and logoff info
ps -efH: command prints the full process list
netstat –tunap: to gather data on network sockets
lsof: lists all open file descriptors and sockets


User Information: Examine the user and group permission files, e.g.,
 /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow and /etc/group
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/shadow
cat /etc/group

Startup Information:

Look at MAC times of all init scripts. May detect suspicious changes:
ls -Rlacrt /etc/init.d
ls -Rlaurt /etc/init.d
ls -Rlart /etc/init.d
Retrieve the inittab configuration file and the associated scripts:
cat /etc/inittab
cat /etc/rc.d/rc
cat /etc/rc.sysinit
cat /etc/rc.local
Retrieve the cron configuration, and any scheduled jobs:
cat /etc/crontab
ls /etc/cron.*
cat /etc/anacrontab
cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/*

Logging Information:
cat /var/log/messages
cat /etc/syslog.conf
cat /var/log/messages
cat /var/log/secure
cat /root/.bash_history
cat /home/*/.bash_history
________________________________________________________________

Some of the keys to look for include the following:
• Malicious or abnormal processes
• Personal security products (PSPs) such as antivirus, firewalls, etc.
• Logging (specifically what might catch or have caught activity of interest)
• Suspicious files or modified system configurations
________________________________________________________________

Shows the system’s network interface configuration
ifconfig –a
ip addr show



arp -v: Displays the ARP cache, which may reveal LAN peers
________________________________________________________________
Displays the routing table
netstat –rn
route –n
ip route list
________________________________________________________________
iptables –L –n: Lists firewall rules
lsof –i -nP: Shows sockets by looking at open files versus networking services. Comparing this output
to the netstat can reveal hidden processes or communications
________________________________________________________________
lsmmod: outputs kernel modules

mount: shows mounted file systems
df -h: shows drive spaced percentage used

cat /etc/mtab: show current mounted file systems
cat /etc/fstab: shows table of file systems available to be mounted
