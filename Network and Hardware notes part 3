-------------------------------------
Lesson 1 - INTRO to WINDOWS

	Versions
		-Before XP was DOS-based kernal versions
		-Since XP moved to the NT kernal
		-XP uses FAT
		-After XP was Windows Vista
		-Vista brought User Account Control
		-Windows 7 is a new an improved Vista
		-Windows 8 in 2012, no start button?!
		-Windows 10 introduced in 2015, brought back the start button and "cortana"
		-Server Versions include
			-Server 2003(XP)
			-Server 2008(Vista/7)
			-Server 2012(Win8/8.1)
			-Server 2016(Win10)
----------------------------------------
Lesson 2 - WINDOWS COMMAND-LINE
	-Since the release of WinXP, the command-line has more capabilities with NT-based kernel opposed to DOS
	
	Interface:
		-Directory structure: file system hierarchy with a root directory and tree of subdirectories
		-Seperated with (\) in Windows
		-Partition root directories named as (C:\, D:\, etc)
----------------------------------------
Lesson 3 - BASIC COMMANDS
	-Commands can be used for data storage, directory mgmt, file mgmt, and system functions

	Topics:
		1.)Command structure
			-Drive letter, directory location, followed by (>)
				-Ex. C:\Users\Public>_
					-Indicates the current directory, type D: to switch to D drive

		2.)Absolute vs. relative path
			-Absolute path is written out and specified
			-Relative is the current directory and can be default if not specified
			-Ex. dir command lists the directory unless specified with dir /Desktop
		
		3.)Wildcards
			-Specialized characters used in place of a file name
			-Ex. (*) used to replace any number of characters
				C:\ dir *.txt 
					-Searches for all .txt files
		
		4.)Command switches
			-Typed after the command to modify or add options
		
		5.)Help
			-Usauge is dispalyed as well as command switch options
			-/? in windows
			
	-Admin controls
		-Format 
			-ex. Format D:
		-Hostname
			-ex. hostname
		-System info
			-ex. systeminfo
		-Version
			-ex. ver
		-Show absolute path
			-ex. path
		
	-Directory command switches
	/P	displays one page of files at a time
	/S	displays files in the specified directory and all of its subdirectories
	/A	displays all files regardless of their DOS attributes (Read only, Archive, System, Hidden)


	-Make directory
		-mkdir
	
	-Change directory
		-cd
	
	-Remove directory and all its contents(with no confirmation prompt)
		-rmdir C:\ /S /Q
		-*dont run this
	
	-Show directory structure
		-tree C:\		
		
	-Copy Command
		ex. copy[SOURCE][DESTINATION]
	
	-Copy all files directories and subdirectories
		ex. xcopy[SWITCHES][SOURCE][DESTINATION]
		/E all directories even empty
		/H copy hidden system files also
	
	-Move command
		ex. move [ORIGINAL PATH] [NEW PATH]

	-Delete command
		ex. del[Filename]

	-Display file contents 
		ex. more[Filename]

	-Find command
		ex. find [/SWITCH] “string” [FILENAME] 
	
	-Repeat what was typed(can output to file with >) echo
		ex. echo "String"
	
	-Display contents of file
		ex. Type

	-Multiple commands to be ran together |
		ex. dir C:\Windows | find /i "dll" | more
			-*finds all dlls in C:\Windows, operates from left to right order
	
	-Redirect output with (>)
		ex.dir /S C:\Windows > C:\dirlist.txt
			*writes the contents of C:\Windows to dirlist.txt

	-Find a jpg and output to a txt file	
		ex. dir /A /S C:\*.* | find /i “jpg” >> C:\dirlist.txt

BATCH FILES
	-Making a batch file allows mutliple commands to be run in a txt file with the .bat extention
	e.x for backup
	@ECHO OFF 
	cd c:\
	REM This is the location of the files that you want to sort
	FOR %%f IN (*.doc *.txt) DO XCOPY c:\"%%f" d:\backup /m /y
	REM This moves any files with a .doc or 
	REM .txt extension from c:\ to d:\backup
	REM %%f is a variable
	FOR %%f IN (*.jpg *.png *.bmp) DO XCOPY C:\"%%f" d:\backup\images /m /y
	REM This moves any files with a .jpg, .png, 
	REM or .bmp extension from c:\ to c:\backup\images

--------------------------------------------------------------------
LESSON 4 - FILE SYSTEM
	-Modern Windows uses NTFS and teh NT Kernal base system
	-Items are store on the user profile
	-User profiles may be processed for potential information for investigative relevance
	
	User Profile
		-Create on first login
		-located at C:\Documents and Settings\%username% in WinXP
		-located a C:\Users\%username% in Vista\Win7 beyond
		-Win8 allowed cloud storage access
	AppData
		-Stores application settings
		-info for roaming users
		-Located in Local , LocalLow(low intergrity tasks) , and Roaming (for roaming)
		
	Junction Points
		-Created so that legacy paths can be redirected to new profile paths
		-can be displayed dir /AL
	
	Time Stamps
		-Stored as local time on FAT and UTC on NTFS
		-Modified date and time is the last time it was opened and saved
		-Created date is when a new file is created on a partition or USB flashdrive

	NTFS
		-Created for and after Vista/Win7
		-Has benefits of file ownership, security, jounaling, efficiency
		-Has ACLs(Access Control Lists)
		-File Permissions:
			-Read, Write, Read&Execute, Modify, Full Control
		-Folder Permissions:
			-Read, Write, List folder contents, Read&Execute, Modify, Full Control
		-Inheritance:
			-Subfolders get parents permissions
		-ACL
			-Right click on a file, select properties, then security tab
		
 
		-EFS(Encrypting File System)
			-Using the cipher command
			-FEK (File encryption key) stored with the file designated by an admin
			-Right click, advanced, security, encrypt

		-Shadow Copies
			-Previous versions or retore points of a file
			-Right click a file select restore previous versions
		
		-Alternate Data Streams(ADS)
			-Attribute of info about a file
			-Can be used to conceal info
			-Can be used by altering names to create multiple data streams
				ex. visable.txt:hidden.txt
------------------------------------------------------------

			ex. DHCP is dependent of TCP/IP driver
		-Services show as Automatic or Manual
		-Right click properties on a service
			-Shows:General, Log on(account under), Recovery, Dependecies

	-BitLocker Drive Encryption

		-There is Public, Private, Domain network types
-----------------------------------------------------------------
LESSON 7 - WINDOWS SERVER
		-Windows Servers can be centrally managed
		-Centrally from Domain Controllers that run ADUC
		-Domain functions are govenered by group policy management
		-Servers create scalable networks

	-Domains
		-Group of networked resources
		-Users may authenticate to a Domain Controller
		-Tree is one or more domains 
		-Forest is one ore more trees with a differnt namespace
		-If domains trust eachother uses in domains can cross domains

	Active Directory Database File
		-NTDS.DIT
		-ADUC info
		-Windows stores account info in SAM file
	
	Server Roles
		Standalone Server
			-Not a member of a domain
		Domain Controllers
			-Contain the info of ADUC
			-Replicate info to all servers
			-Best to keep server roles seperate for security
	
	Read-only Domain Controller(RODC)
		-Proxy only read only

	Group Policy
		-Password policy
		-Account Lockout Policy
		-Kerberos Policy
	Local Policy
		-User Rights
		-Security Options

	Windows Server Security
		-ACLs in a Domain
