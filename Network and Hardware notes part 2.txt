MODULE 2 - Data Storage and Components
________________________________________________________
Introducing disk drives and various removable storage media

--------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 1 - HARD DRIVES

	-Main storage of the computer, write data on platter. HDD and SDD
	
	Hard Drive Overview
		-Saving takes from RAM and stores it to hard drive

	STEPS of Saving to HDD
		1.)Request to save
		2.)File analyzes to find availble space
		3.)Request recieved to transfer from RAM to Disk storage
		4.)File path is saved with a new filename and exact location
		5.)OS with drive controller transfer and save file
		6.)Once saved that area of disk is not accessible by other file saves.

	Hard Drive Components
		• Disk platters: 
				-Non-volatile disk platters made of metal glass with magnetic coating.
				-3.5inch thick, 334GB or higher
				-Data is stored on rings or tracks
				-Tracks are divided into sectors
				-Sector can store 512 bytes up to 4096 bytes
			HDD geometry
				-Track is the entire circle around disk
				-Sector is a division on the track, can exceed 100+
				Platter has: heads, cylinders, groups of sectors(clusters)

			LBA(logical block addressing):assinging numbers to the sectors
	 			-LBA is 28-bit long
				-New 48-bit can support a single drive
	
		• Read/write heads
				-Mechanism that store and read data on the platter
		• Head actuator
		• Spindle motor
		• Jumpers
		• Disk controller
			-Handles the transfer of data between component and computer
			-IDE
				-Built in
				-Connects harddisk to computer
				-
			-EIDE
				-Same thing as PATA
			-PATA
				-Same thing as EIDE
			-SATA
	
	Solid State Drives(SSD)
		-Newer storage used in notebooks, tablets, desktops, servers
		-Less latency, less heat, less power, and electro magnetic delays than HDD
		-Capacity can be from 8 GB to 2 TB +

	SSD Components
		• Controller
			-Directs the flow of information to and from flash storage and SSD internal memory
		• DRAM memory
			-Used by SSD to perform copy and erase
		• NAND flash chips
			-Similar to flashdrive, it is non-volitile, storage using millions of transitors called cells to store data
			-On the SSDs use microscopic cells SLCs(single layer cells) and MLCs(Multi layer) 
			-Each cell is a transitor that holds a 1 or 0 charge
			-Cells form on a grid SLCs are faster
			-Page blocks are groups of cells on a SSD, similar to sector
			-Page can be 2 to 4kb in size
			-Block is a group of pages up to 256 or 512KB
			-Multi blocks make up a NAND flash chip		
		• Connectors for power and data
				

	HARD DRIVE FORMMATTING
		-Preparation to use to store data
			STEPS
			1.)Low-level formatting:
				-Physical manufacture formating to set the drive and tracks and sectors
			2.)Partitioning:
				-Dividing hard disk physical space into defined areas used by the OS
				-Allows dual booting, for different OSs
				-Seperates OS
				-Protects isolation of key files
				-Max number of partions can be 4
				-Disk Managment(windows) and Disk Utility(Mac) are tools used to partition a drive
			3.)High-level formatting
				-Logical formatting performed by the OS
				-Writes the file system to the drive
				-Drive can manage and store data
				-Enables the drive to manage and store data
				-Creates the structure needed to store infor
				-Gathers info about cluster size and avilble space
				-Volumes are formed during high level formatting. E.g. C: drive		
	PARTITION TYPES
	1.)Master boot record(MBR)
			-Traditional partition scheme used by windows, linux, and unix
			-MBR is the most import structure of the partition when using MBR
			-Exists at the first physical sector of drive
			-Maintains info about the physical layout of the disk
				Three substructures
				1.)Master boot program
				2.)Master partition table
				3.)Two-byte “end-of-sector” marker, 0x55AA
			-Limitations of MBR include size limited to 64 bytes
			-In MBR there is a primary and extended partition
			
			•Extended Boot Record: contains a partition table for data and applications
			
			•Volume Boot Record(VBR)
			-Required to sucessfully boot the OS
			-Located at first sector, contains info about file system	
			-Created when volume is formatted
			
	2.)Globally Unique Identifier(GUID) Partitioning
		-Used by Intel and Macs to replace BIOS
		The GUID partition scheme is made up of five pieces:
			• Protective MBR
			• GUID Partition Table (GPT) header
			• The GPT (partition entries)
			• Backup GPT
			• Backup GPT header
		-Advantages over MBR include
			• Support for many partitions
			• Support for up to 10 exabytes (EB) instead of the two-terabyte (TB) limit
			• Provides redundancy with primary and backup tables
			• CRC32 fields are integrated into table for integrity
			• A unique identifier is created for each partition
			• A GUID is used to define partition type
			• Partitions are labeled with a 36 Unicode character readable name

	FORENSIC APPLICATION
	-Physical Storage is the entire storage that resides on the platter or NAND flash
	-Local storage is a defined area on the physical media
	
	HASHING IMAGES				
	-Appyling an algorythm that performs calcualtion on the collection of bits and returns a fixed length hex format
	-MD5(128bit) and SHA1(160bit) are common hash types
	-Changes to a file will change the hash value
	
	FILE SYSTEMS
	-System used to store files
		• File allocation table (FAT)
			-Legacy, Win98.  Some flash drives
			-File size limited to 4GB.  Max volume equaled to 2TB
			 -Divided into four
				discrete areas:
				• Volume boot record (VBR)
				• File allocation tables (FAT; 2)
				• Root directory
				• Data area
			-Directories in FAT contain: Filename, DOS info, time, start cluster, file size.
			-Contain pointers to consecutive clusters

		• New Technology File System (NTFS)
			-Current, Win7
			-Everything is stored in files to easily locate and maintain
			-Security descriptor seperates files
			-Master file table(MFT) records the files on system
			-Every record in NTFS has a header and file attributes
			-Header value includes:
					-Number of times the record has been used
					-Status indicator
					-Is sequential
					-Status indicator showsif file is in allocated or unallocated space
			-File Attributes show:
				-Filename
				-MAC 
				-date/time
				-security descriptors
				-data about file

		• Extended file system (ext2, ext3, ext4)
			-Some Linux
		• Hierarchical file system (HFS, HFS+ and HFSX)
			-OS x	

	RAID(Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
		-Way to combine mulitple hard drives and store date in different locations
		-Can use multiple partitions as one logical drive
		-Methods is striping and mirroring

		RAID Controller
			-software or hardware
			-Manages the flow of data
		Striping
			-Breaking up the storage into 512byte sized blocks or stripes
			-A use for mulitple drives
			-Boostes performance
			-RAID 0	
		Mirroring
			-Mirrors the same data on multiple disks, for fault tolerance
			-RAID 1
		Parity
			-Checking data when copied between storage space
			-Ensuring copied successfully
			-Used for data recovery
			-RAID 5
	Types of RAID
		RAID 0 
			- no fault tolerance, uses Striping 
		RAID 1
			-Disk Mirroring, fault tolerant
		RAID 5
			-Uses stripping with parity
