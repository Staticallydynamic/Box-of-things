Lesson 1
Safety Breifing- 
*Never open power supply or monito chassis
1.)Remove all jewlry
2.)Turn off power and disconnect main power cables
3.)Use a wrist grounding strap

-------------------------------------------
Lesson 2
Components and Terminology
-Computer- performs operations and processes data using switches and transistor to switch on and off with 1s and 0s
-Harware - physical component
-Software- code in a program to dictate computer operations
-BIOS- fireware used at startup boot
-OS - software running on hardware/web browsers and word processors run from OS

BASIC SYSTEM COMPONENTS
1.)Chassis/power supply/cooling
	-Chassis is the case
	-Power allows operation: comes in 100 to 1,00 kw or more
	-Cooling prevents damage

2.)Motherboard
	-Main circuit board
	-Contains: CPU, BUS(pathaways of data signals),Chipset, RAM(memory of what is being processed), Firmware(code stored on ROM,BIOS)
	-BIOS: used to boot commputer is non-voltile
	-UEFI: newer GUI BIOS, more secure

3.)Input and Output components
	Input:
	-Keyboard
	-Mouse
	-Scanner
	Output:
	-Monitor
	-Speakers

4.)Data Storage
	-Primary non-volitile: HDD (hard disk drive) and the newer solid state drive (SSD)
	-removable: Flashdeive, HDD, optic media, SD cards

5.)Communication
	-Components connecting the device to the network
	-Cableing, NIC, wifi card
--------------------------------------------
Lesson 3
Motherboard
-Main circuit board
-Contains CPU, ROM(firmware), Memory(RAM), Chipset, Clock, Storage interface, Expansion slots, Connectors for peripherals
 
TYPES of MOBOs
1.)ATX(advanced technology extended):modern standard for desktops
	-formfactor(9in by 12in wide)
	-Micro-ATX(9.5in by 9.5in)
	-Flashable BIOS
	-Contains PCI, USB, SATA
2.)ITX
	-form factor for small computers, industrial and commercial use.
	-miniITX (17cm by 17cm)
	-nanoITX (12cm by 12cm) - uses ARM or Atom chips

3.)Rasberry Pi
	-(3.3 by 2.1in) small computer mobo, has HDMI and USB.  from 2012

MOBO FIRMWARE
-read-only code stored in the ROM
-BIOS is common firmware
-Newer version is UEFI
	-is more effiecient and greater capacity 
	DIFFERENCES FROM UEFI
	1.)Secure boot with OS launching from a specific cert or signiture	
	2.)EFI shell, GUI
	3.)Supports Hard Drives with GUID partioning tables (GPT) to have disks boot OS

FUNCTIONS of FIRMWARE
1.)Contains and executes power on self-test (POST)
	-POST is a diognaostic utiilty that test crucial components (RAMS, video card, keyboard, disks drives)
	-If failure may beep and display errors

2.)Contains setup program
	-Instructions on screen for configurations
	-BIOS is stored on the seperate chip called the CMOS, UEFI stored in flash memory
3.)Executes bootstrap loader
	Executes where to boot the OS from.  The bootstrap loader
4.)Contains and runs the initial drivers
	-Contains the software driver code that communicates with the hardware


CMOS
	-Complementary metal oxide semiconductor(CMOS)
	-a chip that stores clock settings, POST data, plug and play, BIOS firmware, needs battery

CHIPSET
	-controls the flow of information
	-CPU
	-Cache
	-Main Memory
	-Various PCI and USB
	-System resources
	-North bridge/south and southbridge

JUMPERS
	-metal pins when open can control device settings

TPM(Trusted Platform Module)
	-In Mobo, device used to encrypt. Can store encryption keys and TPM passwords
	-Also can store creds
------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 4
CPU and Memory
	Processor is the CPU, processes user commands and software

CPU components
	1.)ALU(arithmetric logic unit): handles math and logical ops
	2.)CU(control unit):Takes instructions from memory
	3.)Registers:components that hold data to be processed
	
CPU Cores:
	Each core is a unit that can process data seperately, usually 4 or 6

Memory
	-Temporary data storage
	-Houses programs and data to be processed by the CPU
	-Two types, ROM and RAM

	ROM
		-Non volitle
		-Contains BIOS or UEFI
		-Data stored on chip, read-only
		-EEPROM or Flash ROM is a type of ROM, could be reprogrammed. USB flash and SSDs can use EEPROM
	
	RAM
		-Main memory read by the CPU
		-Volitle, requiring power to reside
		-The amount of RAM can increase performace
		-Can include passwords, temp files, browser history, web cache
		-Mounted modules in connection slots
		-Types include: SDRAM, DDR, GDDR for video cards
		-Form factors include: DIMM(workstations) and RIMM(servers)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 5 - BUS pg 23

BUS is a circuit that transports data:
	-Sends signals and powere to and from the CPU
	-Internal bus: connects all internal components of the CPU and main memory
	-Expansion bus: connects expansion boards to the CPU and main memory
	-Measured in width(bit transfer) and clock speed(Hz)

COMMON BUSES
	1.)PCI: 32 or 64 bit connectors
	
	   PCI-E: faster, e for express, more lanes to send data.
	
	2.)USB(universal serial bus)
		-Port connection, used for peripherals.
		-3.0 USB has speeds up to 4.8 Gb/sec 10X faster
	
	3.)IEEE 1394 (FireWire)
		-Fire Wire by apple
	
	-Parallel ATA(PATA)
		-Used to connect optic drives and dvd
	
	-Serial ATA (SATA)
		-allows greater speeds then PATA (600 MB/sec)
		-1/4 cable plugged into the mobo
		-eSATA for external drives

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 6
INPUT/OUTPUT Devices and Ports
	-Components that transfer data into and out of the computer system

	-Input
		-Keyboard, mouse, scanners
	-Output
		-Monitors, video display, audio output
		-Monitors: LCD(laptops, tv, tablets, cellphones, monintors), LED(less power consumption), OLED(flexible, no backlighting)
		-Video Cards
		-Video Display Ports
			-VGA and DVI-I
		-Multimedia ports
			-HDMI(19 pins) (10.2 Gb/s transfer rate)
			-Display
			-PS/2 port: Used for mouse and keyboard
			-Audio ports: 1/8-inch jacks for microphone, speakers, headphones, etc.
			-RJ-45: Standard Ethernet networking port
			-VGA: Legacy video connector
			-DVI: Digital video output
			-HDMI: Audio and video output
			-DisplayPort: Audio and video output
			-FireWire: Often used in video cameras and camcorders
			-USB: Used for a variety of removable media and devices
			-eSATA: Used for external data storage
	-I/O 
		-Touch screen monitors are input and output

Lesson 7
COMPUTER TROUBLESHOOTING
	-Addressing and responding to common computer problems

	Troubleshooting requirements
	1.)Simple process to follow consitently
	2.)Knowlege of what is supposed to happen
	3.)Ability to collect data about the problem

	Steps to Consider
	1.)What are the known facts/symptoms?
	2.)What was supposed to happen?
	3.)Where in hte process did the breakdown occur?
	4.)What are all the possible causes?
	5.)What is the most likely cause or easiest fix to explore?
	6.)Test the theory and document the results.

	Other steps:
	-Check power, loose cables, hardware, peripherals
	-Add harddisk, CD, expansion cards, boot and test after each addition
